# tipping_points

This code calculates the share who will end up doing an activity given the distribution of individual tipping points, initial share who are doing the activity, and population size.

Before running the code, please specify:

1. The distribution of tipping points. These are the $p_i$ parameters (p0, p1, etc.)
2. The side length of the grid l (which leads to a population size l^2).
3. The initial share who do the activity d.
